> Dual-core 16-bit RISC processor.

Limen Alpha is a dual-core 16-bit RISC processor architecture with hardware synchronization support between the cores. The [original code](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/limen) was established in 2015, and then successfully used as a part of [my high school thesis](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/high-school-thesis). However, it has changed a lot since then. The processor has been redesigned to make dual-core possible. Also, hardware interrupt support has been added for both cores.

The work on the processor itself is now finished. However, the used coding conventions may be outdated comparing to my current standards.

## Machine Code
